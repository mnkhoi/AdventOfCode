# Day 2

## Approach

My approach with this problem was to implement the brute force solution.
After thinking about the problem for about 10 minutes I just thought
to myself that I was going to try the brute force solution as I'm blanking out.

## Errors Encountered

- Didn't really understand the question at first.
- Did Part 2 for Part 1 because I didn't read the instructions correctly

## Things to improve

- Slow down and understand the problem first
- You can try the brute force solution in your mind and if it runs fast
enough it might work if you are blanking out
